Kanri has several shortcuts to make navigating the app faster for experienced users.
These are either (double-)click shortcuts or keyboard shortcuts.

## Click shortcuts

- You can rename a board directly by clicking on its title when it is open. Same goes for columns, clicking them once lets you edit their name.
- You can quickly rename a card without opening the pop up by double-clicking it.
- You can bypass the confirmations for deletion on cards and columns by double-clicking the X icon.
- You can also edit card sub-tasks by double-clicking them instead of pressing the pencil icon.
