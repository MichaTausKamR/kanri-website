### Behind the Kanri name

The name "Kanri" is a harmonious fusion of various inspirations, each contributing to the essence and purpose of our application. It embodies a multifaceted concept that combines both technological and organizational elements.

**Kanban + Tauri:** The first part of the name, "Kan," draws its inspiration from "Kanban," a renowned Japanese productivity method that emphasizes visualizing workflow and improving efficiency. Just as Kanban boards help teams streamline their processes, Kanri empowers users to manage their tasks effectively. The "ri" at the end of our name pays tribute to "Tauri," the underlying technology that makes Kanri's offline capabilities possible. Together, "Kanri" signifies a powerful combination of traditional productivity principles and cutting-edge technology.

**Japanese Term "Kanri":** Beyond its connection to Kanban and Tauri, the name "Kanri" also draws inspiration from the Japanese term "Kanri," which translates to "management" or "control." In the context of our application, "Kanri" represents your ability to take control of your tasks, projects, and workflow, all within a highly manageable and efficient system.

**Hoshin Kanri Planning Method:** Additionally, "Kanri" finds inspiration in the "Hoshin Kanri" planning method, which is a strategic planning process used in many Japanese organizations. Hoshin Kanri emphasizes alignment of organizational goals and continuous improvement. In a similar spirit, Kanri encourages users to set clear objectives, prioritize tasks, and work towards their goals methodically.

In essence, the name "Kanri" symbolizes a holistic approach to productivity. It merges the wisdom of Kanban and the innovation of Tauri with the principles of efficient management and strategic planning found in Japanese practices. Kanri, our Kanban board application, is not just a tool; it's a philosophy that empowers users to take control of their work, plan strategically, and achieve their goals efficiently.
